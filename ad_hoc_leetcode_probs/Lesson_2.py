        #question 1- how do I know this is going to work and keep updating. there is not 
        #for loop here. Is it being driven by the last line? 

        #answer from myself- yes 


        ########

        #the tree you are searching for need to have a value that is 
        #smaller than the one you start the root with. 

        #if it does not equal. you have to keep on going. the magic of CS
