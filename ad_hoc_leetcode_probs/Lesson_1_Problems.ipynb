        "This is a really good point. And I'm glad you brought it up, because there is a sense in which these types of problems are very abstracted from from like, day to day work.  Or like real world work. These are algorithm problems right? What we're trying to train here is like, something that's lower level right like a lower level understanding of  of like.  So here's the thing, as we as we we gain more as we do more and more work in in software development, we come across more and more interesting and challenging problems. And it's sort of unpredictable which of those problems you're going to encounter, right? What the advantage of training things like data structures and algorithms is, is that it means that you when you come across a new problem, you have an intuition for what types of algorithms are useful for solving it and the reason that I started us with tree traversal algorithms is because they're part of a larger suite of problems called Graph. traversal. problems, like trees are a special case of graphs and graph traversal problems come up all over in software. They're just incredibly common. And it's things like in your file system that looks like a tree traversal, right. When you have elements in a network that looks like a graph, right? And so very often we have we're using networks that represent things that exist in the real world, whether it be clients and their and their, you know, custom cost like companies and their customers or it could tree could be a your personnel tree at your company. It could be relationships in a social network. It could be in the financial world, we see this stuff come up in terms of I'm actually sure lots of ways that I don't know about, But one thing that I am aware about is it's used by some of the hedge funds in terms of trying to make assessments about relationships between different stocks and things like that.\n",
